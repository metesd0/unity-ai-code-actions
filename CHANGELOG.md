## Notes

### Why These Features?
Based on our competitive analysis and Unity developer needs:
1. **Offline mode** - differentiates from competitors (AI Toolbox, U Coder)
2. **Project context** - makes suggestions actually useful vs. generic AI
3. **Safe modifications** - critical for professional workflows
4. **Unity-specific** - optimized for game dev patterns, not generic code

### Development Philosophy
- Editor productivity first (runtime features later)
- Non-destructive workflow (always preview, never force)
- Privacy-conscious (offline option)
- Cost-aware (token budgeting, local alternatives)
